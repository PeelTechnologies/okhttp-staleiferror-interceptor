# okhttp-staleiferror-interceptor
An okhttp3 interceptor that implements `stale-if-error` Cache-Control directive

HTTP protocol (in [RFC 5861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861)) defines a Cache-Control extension `stale-if-error` that allows a stale cached response to be used if the server is not reachable. OkHttp library, unfortunately, doesnâ€™t implement this extension, hence, we created this project to implement this as an interceptor.

We use the approach presented in the OkHttp [issue 1083](https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/1083)) by retrying a failed request with an `only-if-cached` Cache-Control directive with `max-age` of 4 weeks. 
Example:
```
 OkHttpClient.Builder client = new OkHttpClient.Builder();
 client.addInterceptor(new StaleIfErrorInterceptor());
 
```
The default 4 weeks `max-age` duration can be configured with constructor parameters:
```
 client.addInterceptor(new StaleIfErrorInterceptor(1, TimeUnit.DAYS));
```

# Use with Gradle
add to your repositories

```
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```

In your app build.gradle, add:  `compile "com.github.PeelTechnologies:okhttp-staleiferror-interceptor:1.0.1"`
